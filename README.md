# Droidcon Greece Agenda

A responsive event agenda

## Getting Started

This project is a companion app for the Droidcon Greece 2019, you can use as a starting point for a Flutter application.

You will find some "Hacks" that were necessary because we had some data missing on the sessionize.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Whats next?

At the moment the data is loaded from a static json, but the application is ready to use data from sessionize, the next step is to import those data directly from web.
